Consider this a work-in-progress blog where I will learn Arduino and make a fun "horror room" with lights and sounds. 
This is what I have right now--the room diorama (foam with printed backgrounds), the table and computer (papercraft templates), and the FNAF figure (also papercraft).
This is what I have at the start.
